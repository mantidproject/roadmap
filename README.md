# Mantid Project Roadmap

This repository is intended to communicate the [roadmap](https://github.com/mantidproject/projects/1)
for [Mantid](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid).
For more information on how the roadmap interacts with the collaboration please see the
[governance](https:/github.com/mantidproject/governance/blob/main/governance.md) document.

## Guide

Each item on the roadmap is intended to be a piece of work that will be completed by at least one contributor.
This roadmap is **not** a wish list of changes without effort that is already committed to them.

Each item on the roadmap is an issue that defines either:

* a [capability](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantidproject/roadmap/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
  that will be enhance the software, already estimated to fit within a [release cycle](#releases) or
* a future item, which while committed to by at least one contributor, is under scoped and is intended
  to communicate that work will happen on this subject to prompt possible collaboration discussions.
  These discussions should happen on the issue where possible.

Labels should be used to allow tracking of various aspects of the items: 

* **facility**: Adding a facility label indicates that this facility will be providing resource for this capability.
                Every issue should have atleast one of these labels or it does not belong on this roadmap as
                no one has committed resource to delivering it.
* **needs-scoping**: Adding this label indicates a future item that is under-scoped and requires further breakdown.
                     Once broken down the issue should be closed and subequent capabilty items created.

## Releases

Each column corresponds to an officially scheduled release of mantid.
Scheduled release dates can be found under the
[mantid milestones](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/milestones) page.
